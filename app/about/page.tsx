          Thank you for visiting my independently built Website!! Sourced from a mixture of Open Source Software and Closed Source editing applications including Github, Microsoft Visual Code, Canva, Figma, G-Suite and Adobe Premiere Pro and Audition. I work across both windows and Mac0s systems. I am a Digital Media and culture Graduate from King’s College London, based between London and Manchester. I have strong experience in PR, Marketing and Project Management. I have worked in both professional and volunteer settings, with a focus on accessible collaboration, audience engagement and creative campaigning.

          This website is a creative space featuring topics and ideas that have recently caught my interest. I aim to continue to develop my skills through collaborations with established creative companies and publications, perhaps organisations aiming to produce authentic, informative and accessible storytelling. I love to Write! I offer a British voice, viciously moulded by the major voices of my favourite authors, poets, artists and ‘Wilde’ conversations with my dearest friends and family. I am open to all opportunities in campaigning, copywriting, feature Articles/Columns, PR, Website Building and research.
